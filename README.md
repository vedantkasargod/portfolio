Hi there 
Welcome to the code behind my portfolio website — a minimal, story-driven space to share my work, thoughts, and love for Data Science and AI.

This site is built with clean aesthetics and simple interfaces. But under the hood, it reflects my obsession with building — from pipelines to intelligent systems.  

I enjoy working on:
- GenAI products and LLM tooling.
- Data driven modeling and insight extraction.


###  Tech 

Not the main point, but in case you're wondering:
- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- Deployed via Vercel

My core stack:
- Python
- Frameworks : LangChain ecosystem, Pytorch & Tensorflow, DSPy, HF ecosystem
- End-to-end LLM system engineering
- Setting up evaluation systems (Langfuse)
- Interpretable (via SHAP or LIME) end-to-end ML pipelines on big data
- Multi app container deployment
- Inference latency, error rates, and token usage via Grafana and Prometheus
